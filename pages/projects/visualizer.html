      <h1>Algorithm Visualizer</h1>
      <article id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2> 
        <p>This project is born from the need I had when I discovered algorithm, the need to see the algorithm actions to understand them. At the time there weren't much options out there. Today however, there is plenty of those, <em>especially the great <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tobinatore.github.io">Algovis.io (Open in a new tab)</a></em>. So my goal here is to provide a complete, portable and efficient educational tool. Getting inspiration from the smooth animation showed in the videos of the YouTuber <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic">CodeAesthetic (Open Youtube in a new tab)</a>.</p>
        <p>I will update this blog page after every major updates. Stay tuned, I will create a RSS feed when I have time.</p>
        <p>Posts appear in chronological order. <a aria-label="Navigate to the latest post" href="#last">Take me to the latest update !</a></p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <h3>Why this stack</h3>
        <p>After thinking about it, I chose to start this project using Java. I like Java, for its robusteness and power. Furthermore, since it relies on JVM to compiles to bytecode, it makes it portable for almost any machine. Unless I use some OS-specific instruction, which might not happen since I do not plan to manipulate some Windows Register or MacOS-exclusive features.</p>
        <p>I decided to use Maven as a project manager, since I already have used it for some prior personnal projects. In addition Gradle has a lot of features I won't even need for this project, like the customisation using the Groovy DSL. I just need to manage dependencies, therefore the pom file of maven does exactly that. it also provides templates for most projects, and downloads dependencies, which allow me to quickly dive into the project.</p>
        <p>As for the coding environment, i don't like IDEs, they are too much bloat and overhead to use for me. so i sticked with my good old nvim.</p>
        <p>The framework I decided to use is JavaFX, why JavaFX ? Because compared to Swing it is actively maintained, also it CSS-like styling makes it easier to personalise and tweak. From the industry side, JavaFX is used in most of the companies internal software, making it somewhat of a standard.</p>
        <p>Other solutions exists like Electron or Qt. They are good to some extent, but have some drawbacks. On one hand, Electron while being based on web technologies making it more portable than JavaFX, is built using Chromium tools known for their RAM and CPU consumption. On the other hand, Qt uses C++, which means I have to setup a complete toolchain to target another OS. In addition, Qt does not use standard C++. meaning I have to write more boilerplate code to achieve some small things, like parsing from <code class="inline">QString</code> to <code class="inline">std::string</code> to <code class="inline">char*</code>.</p>

      <article id="beginning">
        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
        <p>Now that's out of the way, let's look into the project. I used the template that is generated using the <a aria-description="External Documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#maven">JavaFX Maven Archetype</a> generating a ready-to-run project, including an Entry point called App.java, and SystemInfo.java. As well as the module-info.java used to define the project dependencies on other modules.</p>
        <p>Let's look at this App.java file :</p>
        <pre><code><span class="keyword">package</span> com.visualizer;

        <p>As expected, this " application " just shows us the basics about the JavaFX architecture and data representation. This code shows that we create a Scene which contains Nodes, this Scene is then staged and showed to us. If this looks like a tree to you, this is normal because JavaFX represents and arranges its objects in a graph. This allow for better performance since the render engine can just load and render a specific set of branches that can dynamically change over time.</p>

        <p> After a push, I checked GitHub reccomendation for a Maven project. I find out a clean GitHub Action runner. It compile the project, automate the tests to detect any failure in the code. For people building from source, it's a good indicator if they want to clone the latest commit or a previous one. This action should send the code to dependabot. If there is a risk of supply chain attack or a vulnerability in one of the dependencies, I will be warned about it.</p>
        <p> the github action script is the following:</p>
        <pre><code><span class="comment"># this workflow will build a java project with maven, and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time

        <h3>MVVM implementation</h3>
        <p>Reading through the documentation, I found out that it is recommended to use the <abbr title="Model View ViewModel">MVVM</abbr> design pattern when using JavaFX Which makes sense; MVVM separates the UI from the Business Layer and the data access, this decoupling makes the unit testing easier but first of all, it helps reducing the error induced when modifying the Model or the styles. And it explains the choice of a CSS-like styling approach. Since this styling code is unaware of the View, modifying it won't induce side effects at all... Well, it will if this is ugly, but this will not cause errors in the business logic. And if it does... What monstrosity did you come up with exactly ? Jokes aside, MVVM isolates and decouple much the different stages of the UI and the business logic compared to <abbr title="Model View Controller">MVC</abbr> for example, making it prone for <abbr title="SOLID is a set of programming principles for OOP and a mnemetic abbreviation, each letters refers to a principle.">SOLID</abbr> compliance and testability.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, I structured my projects around 5 main folders which are the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>View: Where <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> Controls Resides</li>
          <li>ViewModel: Contains the Screen State and the UI Logic.</li>
          <li>Model: Function Call to business logic and data access</li>
          <li>DomainObject: UI-Neutral transfer Object</li>
          <li>Converter: Helper Class for ViewModel to Model communication</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When I first started this project, I had a misconception of this pattern. As I understood it, the Model object was supposed to contain every Abstract class, enums or interfaces, while the DomainObject was supposed to contain the Business Logic. I Also falsly thought that View folder should contain everything UI-related. This is why during first version the <code class="inline">View</code> abstract class was inside View folder.</p>
          <p>To be honest, those <em>bugs</em> are the worst, they are insidious, doesn't trigger any errors, doesn't prevent the code from working. However, it gives you a lot of headache when you try to explain your architecture, or to write about your project. And guess what ? It was while writing those articles and talking about it to a close friend that it struck me. " My design pattern sucks, I should read further about it ". And I did, one of the best decision of my life.</p>
          <p>But how do I plan to implement that now ? Well luckily I made a small <abbr title="Unified Model Language">UML</abbr> class Diagram, a tool that is not used as often as it should be. If what you are doing is stupid, you'll know it by looking at the Diagram, the diagram is also a good indicator to check if your solution is too complex. Generally, if you strugle to find the good rules to express your architecture, or if Visual Paradigm needs 5 minutes to loads your saved project... Maybe there is a problem with your architecture.</p>

            <p>The <code class="inline">SelectorView</code> class is a generalization of the generic abstract class <code class="inline">View</code>. The T type of this class is destined to bind to the <code class="inline">SelectorViewModel</code> class which implements the <code class="inline">SelectorService</code> interface. As I am using a Pair of String, a JavaFX object representing tuples, I added another dependency for the SelectorView.

          </code></pre>
          <p>This class uses a generic type T that allow me to set any viewModel to any view. Note : for one of the implementation I've done, this generic type was narrowed down to an interface called ViewModel. However, after thinking about it. It quickly became clear that if I kept that implementation, I would not respect the <abbr title="Liskov substitution principle, the L in SOLID">L</abbr> and the <abbr title="Interface segregation principle, the I in SOLID">I</abbr> from the SOLID.</p>
          <p>It would not have respected the Liskov substitution, because I could not have switched my viewModel class for another kind of class without breaking everything</p>
          <p>It would not have respected the Interface segregation principle because for an interface <code class="inline">ViewModel</code> to exists, it should have known every contract of every ViewModel, the implementation had to be done this way:</p>
          <pre><code>
<span class="keyword">interface</span> <span class="class">ViewModel</span> <span class="keyword">extends</span> ViewModelA, ViewModelB...
{}</code></pre>
          <p>Which is a very bad implementation, since it would add more coupling and friction. Breaking everything at the first refactor and making it hard to test or mock.</p>
          <p>Based on this <code class="inline">View</code> class. I created the SelectorView. Its purpose is to let the user chose a programming language from a predefined List.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create the ViewModel</li>
            <p>Wait who's put this error here ? Answer, no one. We are doing <abbr title="Model View ViewModel">MVVM</abbr> here, and the entry point of the MVVM pattern is the ViewModel. So while you can starts with the View, this is way easier to starts with the ViewModel and only then create the View.

            <p>Now you might ask, why is there an array of Pair sitting in on of the the Consttructor's methods ? What is this listener stuff ? I Will respond to these questions. First of all, this array is the population of the ChoiceBox. We put this here because the population of a ChoiceBox is linked to the creation of the UI, therefore it belongs to the ViewModel. ViewModel which constructs the View based on the output of Business Layer output, while the View just display the curated informations.</p> 
            <p>Now for the Listener. In JavaFX there is Observable Values, if you're familliar with Angular, it's almost the same concept. If you're not, have a small breakdown. When an Observable Value is changed, it triggers an event. The listener is here to listen to this event then as a response, dispatch the new value and execute some logic. Right now, each time the value changes a String text is updated. The ViewModel does not need to know about our ChoiceBox, Label, Buttons or anything, to do his work, he just need to know what kind of property it's dealing with. In our case, a String and some Pair of String, nothing more.</p>
            <p>Now the reason it is in the constructor is quite simple, the ViewModel is the entry of the View, the listener has to be set and the ChoiceBox populated before the View is rendered, without it an update or an user action will be necessary to trigger them. The other way to solve this problem would be to break the <abbr title="Model View ViewModel">MVVM</abbr> pattern and put that logic into the View. We do not want to do that because we respect MVVM here. That's why we call these two methods in the constructor.  
            <p>I attached an interface to this ViewModel, while this is not an obligation, this is not a bad thing to do, it helps with the reusability of components and mockability for testing. This interface is the following</p>
            <pre><code><span class="keyword">package</span> com.visualizer.ViewModel.Contract;

<span class="keyword">import</span> javafx.beans.property.ObjectProperty;
<span class="keyword">import</span> javafx.collections.ObservableList;
<span class="keyword">import</span> javafx.util.Pair;

<span class="keyword">public interface</span> SelectorService
{
  ObservableList&lt;Pair&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; getChoices();
  ObjectProperty&lt;Pair&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; selectedPairProperty();
}</code></pre>
            <p>Let me just point that, the interface does not need to contain <strong>everything</strong> your program will ever used, this is true for every progr=m. This is also exactly what the Interface Segregation principle is about. An Interface need to know only what's necessary for it implementation. In this case what do I need ? Fundamentaly I need to return the population of all possible choices, and the currently selected value. This is the bare minimum for this interface, the rest in the <code class="inline">SelectorViewModel</code> class is just implementation detail.</p>

            <p>Now, you might want to know what this <code class="inline">PairStringAbout</code> that <code class="inline">SelectorView</code> is depending on. A converter is a special type of class that translates data from ViewModel to DomainObjects. For us we just need it to display the Key of the Pair, to do so we just need to override the default <code>tostring()</code> and <code>fromstring()</code> methods just like this:</p>

            <p>As you can see, this Converter has a very specific behaviour when Overriding <code>fromString</code>. It always throw an exception, which is normal. I won't build a pair from a string. But since the <code class="inline">StringConverter</code> class expect this method to be Overriden, I override it to only throw exception with an error message.</p>
            <li>Create the View</li>
            <p>now that the Converter case is done, this is time to assemble every pieces into one... The View and I have to admit... Once you wrote the dependant code, this is just way easier to write this part, you just have to do lego with the code:</p>
            <pre><code><span class="keyword">package</span> com.visualizer.View.Selector;

<span class="keyword">import</span> javafx.collections.ObservableList;
<span class="keyword">import</span> javafx.collections.FXCollections;
<span class="keyword">import</span> javafx.scene.control.ChoiceBox;
<span class="keyword">import</span> javafx.scene.control.Label;
<span class="keyword">import</span> javafx.scene.control.ToolBar;
<span class="keyword">import</span> javafx.util.Pair;

<span class="keyword">import</span> com.visualizer.Converter.PairStringConverter;
<span class="keyword">import</span> com.visualizer.Model.View;
<span class="keyword">import</span> com.visualizer.ViewModel.Selector.SelectorViewModel;

<span class="keyword">public class</span> <span class="class">SelectorView</span> <span class="keyword">extends</span> View<SelectorViewModel>
{
    <span class="keyword">private final</span> ChoiceBox&lt;Pair&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; language = <span class="keyword">new</span> ChoiceBox&lt;&gt;();
    <span class="keyword">private final</span> Label textLabel = <span class="keyword">new</span> Label(<span class="string">""</span>);

    <span class="keyword">public</span> SelectorView(<span class="type">SelectorViewModel</span> viewModel)
    {
      <span class="keyword">super</span>(viewModel);
      createView();
    }

    <span class="decorator">@Override</span>
    <span class="keyword">protected</span> void createView()
    {
      language.<span class="function">setItems</span>(viewModel.<span class="function">getChoices</span>());
      Pair&lt;String, String&gt; defaultLanguage = language.<span class="function">getItems</span>().<span class="function">get</span>(<span class="integer">0</span>);
      language.<span class="function">setValue</span>(defaultLanguage);

      viewModel.<span class="function">selectedPairProperty</span>().<span class="function">bind</span>(language.<span class="function">getSelectionModel</span>().<span class="function">selectedItemProperty</span>());

      textLabel.<span class="function">textProperty</span>().<span class="function">bind</span>(viewModel.<span class="function">labelTextProperty</span>());

      language.<span class="function">setConverter</span>(<span class="keyword">new</span> PairStringConverter());

      <span class="keyword">ToolBar</span> tools = <span class="keyword">new</span> ToolBar(
        language,
        textLabel
      );

      <span class="keyword">this</span>.<span class="function">getChildren</span>().<span class="function">add</span>(tools);
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>Now this one can be tricky. But this is really simple. The View construct what's visible on the UI. First, we fill the ChoiceBox using the <code class="inline">getChoices</code> method defined earlier in the VIewModel. Then, while generally for the default choice an empty pair of string is chosen, I prefer to set the first items of the ChoiceBox as the default one. In this case Pascal lang is the default.</p>
            <p>The bind instruction, this instruction allow an one-to-one communication between a component and an Observable. This is at this moment we detail which element will be receive update from the observer and which one the ViewModel will actually listen to the changes.</p>
            <p>Then I set the converter for the ChoiceBox. Normally for a <code class="inline">Pair&lt;String, String&gt;</code> the Stringified output wille be something like : <code class="inline">"Key=pair"</code> However, we do not want that in our ChoiceBox, that's why we wrote the Converter to Override this behaviour and just output the key.</p>
            <p>To render this, we just have to add those two leaf nodes into a branch node, in my case a <code class="inline">ToolBar</code> and added it to the parent branch Node it will belong to.</p>
            <p>Finally, in the app.java I just have to remove the debug label for this actual View.</p>
            <pre><code><span class="keyword">public void</span> start(<span class="type">Stage</span> stage) <span class="keyword">throws</span> Exception 
{ 
  var view = <span class="keyword">new</span> SelectorView(new SelectorViewModel());
  Scene scene = new Scene(view, <span class="integer">800</span>, <span class="integer">600</span>); 
  stage.<span class="function">setScene</span>(scene);
  stage.<span class="function">show</span>();
}</code></pre>

            <p>And this is done. The basic implementation for the the first view is done. We have a good project structure, a relatively SOLID approach, so I can continue to work on this project the mind free.</p>
